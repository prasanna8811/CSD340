        <h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            I grew up in a small town where everyone knew each other. Life was simple, and I spent most of my childhood playing outside with friends. The town had a close-knit community that always supported one another.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My hobbies include photography, videography, and hiking. <span class="sentence">Capturing beautiful moments through my camera has always been a passion of mine.</span> I love exploring new places and taking pictures of landscapes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My family has always been my biggest support system. I have two siblings, and we share a lot of great memories together. Growing up, we would go on road trips every summer, which made for some of the best experiences of my life.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Currently, I am studying web development and learning how to build web pages. I find HTML and CSS fascinating, and I enjoy designing layouts and styling elements. I look forward to improving my skills and becoming proficient in front-end development.
